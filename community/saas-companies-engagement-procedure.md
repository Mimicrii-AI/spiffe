## Procedure for Engaging With SaaS Companies

### Summary

This document outlines the procedure for engaging with SaaS companies, and
how SaaS companies can represent themselves and their interests in the SPIFFE
community.

The goal is to provide a clear and consistent process for engaging with 
SaaS companies that are included but not limited to those that use SPIFFE and 
SPIRE, provide a proprietary SPIFFE-compatible service, or are interested in 
contributing to the SPIFFE project.

More specifically, this document includes guidelines for communication, 
technical contact designation, and handling potential disruptive participants.

### Technical Contacts

#### Objective

To ensure effective communication and support for SaaS consumers 
using the SPIFFE specification by designating responsible technical contacts.

#### Guidelines

##### Designation of Contacts

Each SaaS company that directs customers to the SPIFFE Slack channel must 
designate two technical contacts.

These contacts will serve as the primary point of contact for addressing queries 
and facilitating communication between the customers and the Spiffy community.

##### Documentation of Contacts

A dedicated folder for each company will be created in the SPIFFE repository
under the `./community/saas-technical-contacts` directory.

The folder will contain:

* Names and contact information of the designated technical contacts.
* Guidelines for interaction and support procedures.
* Any relevant documentation provided by the company.

### Interaction Protocols

#### Objective

To establish clear protocols for interactions between SaaS consumers and the 
SPIFFE community to ensure a productive and respectful environment.

#### Guidelines

##### Communication Etiquette

All interactions should be professional, respectful, and focused on technical 
issues.

Technical contacts are responsible for ensuring that their customers, and anyone
who join the community through their reference adhere to the community 
guidelines and maintain a positive environment.

##### Issue Resolution

Technical contacts should facilitate the resolution of technical issues by 
providing detailed information and context.

For complex issues, technical contacts should coordinate with SPIFFE maintainers 
and contributors to find solutions.

##### Feedback Mechanism

SPIFFE Steering Committee encourages SaaS consumers to provide feedback on their 
experience with the SPIFFE specification and the support received.

SPIFFE Steering Committee will use this feedback to improve documentation, 
support processes, and community guidelines.

### Managing Disruptive Participants

#### Objective

To identify and manage participants who disrupt the community, ensuring that 
the SPIFFE Slack channel remains a productive and positive space.

#### Guidelines

##### Identification of Disruptive Behavior

Disruptive behavior includes, but is not limited to, spamming, harassment, and 
consistently off-topic discussions.

Technical contacts should monitor interactions and identify any disruptive 
behavior from their customers.

##### Initial Warning

If a participant is identified as disruptive, a warning should be issued 
outlining the behavior and the consequences of continued disruption.

Technical contacts are responsible for communicating the warning to the 
participant.

##### Escalation Process

If the disruptive behavior continues, escalate the issue to the SPIFFE 
Steering Committe.

The SSC will evaluate the situation and decide on appropriate actions, which may 
include temporary or permanent removal from the Slack channel.

##### Documentation and Reporting

SSC will document all incidents of disruptive behavior, including the 
participant's actions, warnings issued, and any subsequent actions taken.

SSC will maintain a private report of these incidents to ensure confidentiality 
and privacy.
